#PScout Android Permission Mappings

This repository contains Android API calls to permissions mappings generated 
with the help of the [PScout](http://pscout.csl.toronto.edu/) tool. 

The aim of this repository is to collect mappings for all Android API versions. 
The initial research paper only partially covers Android versions. 

The mappings initially included as a part of the PScout distribution can be 
found in [old_results](./old_results) folder.

New results sorted by API version can be found in the [results](./results) 
folder.
